ACT CONFIDENT! BREATHE! THIS TEST IS YOUR BITCH! DOING YOUR BEST IS ENOUGH! YES IT IS!
This test is just a conversation with a friend. One in a million tests. Like a grain of sand.


1. Read first assignment.
2. console.log("-------------Exercise 1 - Title--------------");
3. Mark easy ones: ***** 5 stars super hard, * 1 star super easy
One by one
Don't start solving until you are through the whole list!
4. Write down all functions where needed
5. Do all EASY exercises first!!!!!!!!!!!!!
6. If one exercise takes more than 12 minutes SKIP it!!! (16 minutes total)
7. Explain yourself with comments!
Write into comment why/how you got stuck and that you will come back to it given the time: //got stuck, will come back to it given time

8. CALM THE FUCK DOWN! BREATHE!You promised yourself not to panic. DOING YOUR BEST IS ENOUGH! YES IT IS!




Practice test Feb 9th: 7 assignments, 2 hours, no breaks, 16 minutes per exercise
(no objects in this one!)

Other rules to worry about later:

- Don't get distracted by surroundings or human stuff
- use comments
