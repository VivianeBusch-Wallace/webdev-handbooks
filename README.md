Here I gather all the information that I have learned. This is a collection of notes, templates, explanations, examples, and cheat sheets. Everything that I need to see together to help me learn and teach others. I hope this is also useful for others who are starting out, although sometimes I will take notes in "Vivi language", however I still hope that it's understandable. You can contact me, if you have any questions.
