loop through object and print
return an array of properties from object
print stuff with a method from object
array of all values in object's properties

Object.entries()

delete an object property:
delete objName.keyName

checking if an object has a property:
objectName.hasOwnProperty()

protecting an object from changes:
Object.seal

More practice:
check if number is within given range of an object's min and max properties

scrabble: count maximum score of scrabble tiles
special version with reduce

empty object: checking if an object is empty: Object.keys(obj).length

counting letters: returning the count as value of each letter
special solution with two functions and two loops

free shipping: does the order get free shipping or not

programming object:
add sth to value array in an object
delete a keyword
