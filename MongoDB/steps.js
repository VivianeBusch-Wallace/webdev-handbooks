// Model
/*
A Model is a class that's your primary tool for interacting with MongoDB. An instance of a Model is called a Document.
In Mongoose, the term "Model" refers to subclasses of the mongoose.Model class. You should not use the mongoose.Model class directly. The mongoose.model() and connection.model() functions create subclasses of mongoose.Model as shown below.
