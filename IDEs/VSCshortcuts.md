##HTML

###HTML abbreviations
Sometimes you can spend longer learning to type out shortcuts than if you just manually typed the code. I personally don't find Emmet abbreviations a time saver for writing CSS, but some of the HTML abbreviations I find useful include:

Nested elements
The shortcut nav>ul>li creates:

<nav>
  <ul>
    <li></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
Multiple elements
The shortcut li*5 creates:
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
Tags with text
The shortcut a{Click Me} creates:
<a href="">Click Me</a>
Elements with multiple classes
The shortcut div.first-class.second-class creates:
<div class="first-class second-class"></div>
Elements with IDs
The shortcut div#main creates:
<div id="main"></div>

##Terminal

###most used
pwd
cd
cd .. -> goes up one directory
ls
mkdir
code
touch
(tab) -> fills out rest of the filename/directory name starting with whatever you started to type
(up arrow) -> goes through other commands you typed in before (even one not executed), is often faster than typing git add . && git commit -m "commit message" again

###also neat
open . -> opens current directory in finder window
open <filename> -> opens file in finder window
grab a file/directory from your folder window and put it into terminal after 'cd ' --> this will automatically open up the path to that file/directory
ls -all -> detailed list incl. hidden files with more detailed information

##Git

###basic
git init
